# sponsor-spotlight

This project would like to extend a warm shoutout to our fantastic Github monthly sponsors. Approximately 70% of requests will feature a randomly selected sponsor, with the remaining being utilized for onboarding new sponsors.

#### Usage

Simply use the image endpoint `https://sponsor-spotlight.vercel.app/sponsor` and append your GitHub Sponsor program-eligible username as the `login` query parameter. For example:

```markdown
![shoutout-sponsors](https://sponsor-spotlight.vercel.app/sponsor?login=ful1e5)
```

This will display a "Shoutout" image for a random sponsor with every request.

In some instances, you may receive a message for onboarding new sponsors.

If you have not joined the GitHub Sponsorship program or if your GitHub username cannot be found, the following will appear:

### Development

Images are generated by a React component and is embedded within an SVG. You can run the project locally using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
vercel dev
```

And also require Github personal access token (classic) with `read:org` and `read:user` permissions because it is necessary to access Github graphql API and assigned with `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` NodeJS environment variable. Read more on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/about-the-graphql-api)

```env
# .env
GH_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
```
